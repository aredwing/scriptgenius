Script Genius is a model development by Allen J. Redwing to help analyze film scripts. 

Updating: 

Based on our chat history, it seems that you are trying to create a language model that can analyze movie scripts and provide insights on various aspects of the script such as plot, characters, dialogue, themes, and more. You want the model to be able to evaluate a script based on specific criteria such as story premise, genre, structure, characters, dialogue, emotional impact, theme, visual imagery, marketability, cultural relevance, production feasibility, global appeal, and more.

The Script Genius model should be able to analyze each scene in a script and provide a score for each criterion based on its relevance to the scene. These scores can then be aggregated to provide an overall score for the scene, as well as for the entire script.

In addition to the numerical scores, the Script Genius model should be able to provide expert analysis and feedback on the script based on the scores and other factors such as plot consistency, character development, pacing, and more. This feedback can be used by scriptwriters to improve their scripts and make them more engaging and marketable.

Overall, the goal of the Script Genius model is to provide a comprehensive and objective analysis of a movie script, helping scriptwriters to identify areas of improvement and enhance the quality of their work.
